## Tasks

This is an individual lab in your `csi3x40_labs`
repository from previous labs.

### 1. Set Up Your Project

Create a branch `f-lab02` and push it
to
[GitHub](https://github.com/).

Create a directory `lab02`
(our working directory for this lab)
and commit empty `resume.html` and `styles.css`
files and push to [GitHub](https://github.com/).


### 2. Create/Migrate your resume

Create (or if you already have a resume, migrate) your resumt
based on HTML and CSS.  Use the components from class
and separate your HTML into the `resume.html` file
and your CSS styles in the `styles.css` file.

### 3. Code Review

Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
and invite a student to review.

The other student should review / comment on your work.
If time allows, address the comments (amend existing commits
or push new commits to your branch).

You may also be invited to review someone else's
work.  You should focus on the structure of the HTML
and CSS not necessarily on the content of the resume itself.

Merge your pull-request and will
[git switch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch/2.23.0)
back to main on your local repo.
